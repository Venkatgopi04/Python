Q1)What is the difference between a Program & a Script?


Python as a Program:
=============
If the developers/programmers/Software developers/application developers 
are writing the business logic without using any predefine module then Python 
act as a Program

Ex1:
==
print('Core Python session is going on ...')
print()
print("Core Python session is going on ....")
print()
print('''Core Python session is going on ...''')
print()
print("""Core Python session is going on ...""")
print()
print("End of an application")


Ex2:
==
print('Core Python')
print()
print('Advance Python')
print()
print('FrontEnd with Django & Django_Rest_Framework')
print()
print('ReactJS/Angular with FastAPI/Flask')
print()
print("End of an application")


Python as a Script:
============
If the developers/programmers/software developers/application developers are
writing the business logic with one or more than one predefine module then Python 
act as a Script.


Note:
====
In Python Programming language we do have 160000+ Predefine modules are there


time module:
========
It is a predefine module in python.The main objective of time module is to work on 
time in hour_format,minute_format,second_format.To use time module inside the python
we use import module_name

import time 
time.sleep(3) --->seconds


Ex1:
===
import time 
time.sleep(3)
print("Welcome to Quality Thought for Full Stack Python Development with CLoud")



Ex2:
===
import time 
print('Core Python')
print()
print('Advance Python')
print()
print('FrontEnd with Django & Django_Rest_Framework')
print()
print('ReactJS/Angular with FastAPI/Flask')
print()
time.sleep(2)
print("End of an application")


id():
===
It is a predefine function in Python.The main objective of id() function is to know the 
adderss of a variable at memory allocation where our data is stored at memory allocation.


Ex1:
===
import time 
Eid=1002
print(Eid)
print()
print(id(Eid))
print()
time.sleep(2)
print("End of an application")


Ex2:
==
import time 
Eid=1001 
print("Eid is:",Eid)
print()
print("Address of Eid is:",id(Eid))
print()
time.sleep(2)
print('End of an application')


Interview_Question:
=============
Q1)What is the difference between Java & Python Programming Language?


type():
====
It is a predefine function in Python.The main objective of type() function is to know 
the what type of data type we are using in our Python Script/Python Program.

a=10
type() -----><class 'int'>


Ex1:
===
import time 
Eid=1001 
print("Eid is:",Eid)
print()
print("Address is:",id(Eid))
print()
print("Data type is:",type(Eid))
print()
time.sleep(2)
print('End of an application')


Note:
===
All data types in Python are classes.
