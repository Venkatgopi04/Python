Interview Question from Python:
==============================
Q1)Why can't I use an assignment in an expression?

The reason for not allowing assignment in Python expressions is a common, hard-to-find bug in those other languages, 
caused by this construct

if (x = 0) {
...error handling...
}
else {
...code that only works for nonzero x...
}


Q2)Is there a tool to help find bugs or perform static analysis?

Pychecker and Pylint are the static analysis tools that help to find bugs in python. 
Pychecker is an open source tool for static analysis that detects the bugs from source code and warns about the style and complexity of the bug


Q3)How do you set a global variable in a function?

Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function. To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword

Q4)What are the rules for local and global variables in Python?

In python, the variables referenced inside a function are global.
When a variable is assigned new value anywhere in the body of a function then it is assumed as local.
In a function, if a variable ever assigned new value then the variable is implicitly local and explicitly it should be declared as global.


Q5)How can we create an empty class in Python?

In Python, to write an empty class pass statement is used. Pass is a special statement in Python that does nothing. It only works as a dummy statement. However, objects of an empty class can also be created.

Q6)What are the key features of Python?

Python is a dynamic, high level, free open source and interpreted programming language. It supports object-oriented programming as well as procedural oriented programming. In Python, we don't need to declare the type of variable because it is a dynamically typed language.


Q7)What is the difference between list and tuple in Python?

One of the most important differences between list and tuple is that list is mutable, whereas a tuple is immutable. This means that lists can be changed, and tuples cannot be changed.


Q8) List steps for setting up static files in Django?

set STATIC_ROOT in settings.py
run python2.7 manage.py collectstatic (or python3.5 or python3.6 as appropriate)
Set up a Static Files entry on the PythonAnywhere Web tab.


Q9)What is Dogpile effect?

The Dogpile effect occurs when cache expires and websites are hit by numerous requests the same time. Dogpile effect can be prevented using semaphore lock.


Q10)How do I share global variables across modules?

In the update.py file, we import the config.py module and modify the values of a and b . Similarly, in the main.py file, we import both config.py and update.py module. Finally, we print and test the values of global variables whether they are changed or not.

Q11)How do we reverse a list in Python

Reversing a list in-place with the list. reverse() method. Using the “[::-1]” list slicing trick to create a reversed copy. List comprehension and loop statement can also help.


Q12)How can Python be an interpreted language?

Python is called an interpreted language because it goes through an interpreter, which turns code you write into the language understood by your computer's processor. Python is an “interpreted” language. This means it uses an interpreter. An interpreter is very different from the compiler.


Q13)What do you understand by the term PEP8?

PEP 8 stands for Python Enhancement Proposal which ,is Python's style guide. It's a set of rules for how to format your Python code to maximize its readability.

Q14)Define slicing in Python?

Python slicing is about obtaining a sub-string from the given string by slicing it respectively from start to end. Python slicing can be done in two ways.

slice() Constructor ,Syntax string[start:end:step] start, end and step have the same mechanism as slice() constructor.


Q15)How can I pass optional or keyword parameters from one function to another?

To pass the keywords from func() into funcy(),
def func (**kwargs):
 print('func kwargs:', kwargs)
def funcy (a, b, c, **kwargs):
  print('other args:', a, b, c)
  print('keyword args:', kwargs)
def funcy(a, b, c, **kwargs):
    print('other args:', a, b, c)
    print('keyword args:', kwargs)
    func(**kwargs)


Q16)How do you make a higher order function in Python?

A higher-order function accepts one or more functions as input and returns a new function. Sometimes it is required to use function as data. - To make high order function , we need to import functools module.

Q17)How do I copy an object in Python

In Python, there are two ways to create copies
Deep copy
Shallow copy

Q18)How can I find the methods or attributes of an object?

Attributes of a class can also be accessed using the following built-in methods and functions:
getattr() – This function is used to access the attribute of object.
hasattr() – This function is used to check if an attribute exist or not.
setattr() – This function is used to set an attribute.


Q19)What type of language is Python? Programming or Scripting?

Python is considered a scripting language because of a historical blur between scripting languages and general purpose programming languages. In fact, Python is not a scripting language, but a general purpose programming language that also works nicely as a scripting language. It is also an interpreted and high-level programming language for the purpose of general programming requirements.


Q20)What are the applications of Python?

Web and Internet Development
Scientific and Numeric Applications
Education and training programs
Artificial intelligence and Machine learning
Software and Game Development
Business Application

Q21)Which command is used to delete files in Python?

In Python, you can use the os. remove() method to remove files, and the os. rmdir() method to delete an empty folder. If you want to delete a folder with all of its files, you can use the shutil.

Q22)Define the term lambda?

In Python, a lambda function refers to a small anonymous function. We call them “anonymous functions” because technically they have no name. Unlike a normal function, we do not define it with the standard keyword def that we use in Python

Q23)Why do we use the split method in Python?

Split Function is In-Build function of Python String Data Type, The Main purpose of split data type is to separate the string into different elements, and the separated string will actually store in the format of List data type.

Q24)Define modules in Python

A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. A module can define functions, classes, and variables. A module can also include runnable code. Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use.

Q25)What are Python Decorators?

Decorators are a very powerful and useful tool in Python since it allows programmers to modify the behaviour of function or class. Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behaviour of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it.

Q26)How do we find bugs and statistical problems in Python?

Pychecker and Pylint are the static analysis tools that help to find bugs in python.

Q27)What is the difference between .py and .pyc files?

py files contain the source code of a program. Whereas,. pyc file contains the bytecode of your program.


Q28)What do you understand by the term namespace in Python?

A namespace is a system that has a unique name for each and every object in Python. An object might be a variable or a method. Python itself maintains a namespace in the form of a Python dictionary.


Q29)Write a program to display the Fibonacci sequence in Python?

def Fibonacci(n):
 # Check if input is 0 then it will
# print incorrect input

if n < 0:
 print("Incorrect input")
  # Check if n is 0
# then it will return 0
elif n == 0:
 return 0
# Check if n is 1,2
 # it will return 1
 elif n == 1 or n == 2:
 return 1
else:
return Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2)
# Driver Program
print(Fibonacci(9))

Q30)Why should we use Django framework?

Django is an open-source framework for backend web applications based on Python — one of the top web development languages. Its main goals are simplicity, flexibility, reliability, and scalability. Django has its own naming system for all functions and components (e.g., HTTP responses are called “views”).

Q31)List out the inheritance styles in Django?

Abstract Base Class Inheritance->This style is used when you only want the parent class to hold information that you don't want to type out for each child model

Q32)Does Python make use of access specifiers

Python doesn't have any mechanism that effectively restricts access to any instance variable or method. Python prescribes a convention of prefixing the name of the variable/method with a single or double underscores to emulate the behaviour of protected and private access specifiers.


Q33)Write Python code to sort a numerical dataset?

# Python program to demonstrate sorting by user's choice 
# function to return the second element of the 
# two elements passed as the parameter 

def sortSecond(val): 
return val[1] 
# list1 to demonstrate the use of sorting using second key 
list1 = [(1, 2), (3, 3), (1, 1)] 
# sorts the array in ascending according to second element 
list1.sort (key = sortSecond) 
print(list1) 
# sorts the array in descending according to second element 
list1.sort (key = sortSecond, reverse = True) 
print(list1) 

Q34)What is the difference range and xrange

range returns the data in list format
xrange returns the data in generator objects


Q35)What is difference between tell() & seek() function in Python?

tell() functions is used to check current cursor pointer of file which is 0 bydefault

seek() functions is used to change the position of cursor pointer of file

Q36)Why do we use a cookie in Django?

A cookie is a small piece of information which is stored in the client browser. It is used to store user's data in a file permanently (or for the specified time). Django provides built-in methods to set and fetch cookie.

Q37)How can we access a module written in Python from C?

The header file in your C source file, which gives you access to the internal Python API used to hook your module into the interpreter. Make sure to include Python, before any other headers you might need.


Q38)Differentiate between SciPy and NumPy?

Both NumPy and SciPy are Python libraries used for used mathematical and numerical analysis. NumPy contains array data and basic operations such as sorting, indexing, etc whereas, SciPy consists of all the numerical code

Q39)Why do we use join() function in Python?

The join() method provides a flexible way to create strings from iterable objects. It joins each element of an iterable (such as list, string, and tuple) by a string separator (the string on which the join() method is called) and returns the concatenated string.

String join() function:

firstname = "Bugs"
lastname = "Bunny"
# define our sequence                                                    
sequence = (firstname,lastname)
# join into new string                                                   
name = " ".join(sequence)
print(name) 

Array join() function:

words = ["How","are","you","doing","?"]
sentence = ' '.join(words)
print(sentence)	

 



Q40)Define Python Path?

PYTHON PATH is an environment variable which you can set to add additional directories where python will look for modules and packages. For most installations, you should not set these variables since they are not needed for Python to run. Python knows where to find its standard library.


Q41)How memory management is done in Python?

Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager.

Q42)What are Dict and List comprehensions in Python?

In Python, dictionary comprehensions are very similar to list comprehensions – only for dictionaries. They provide an elegant method of creating a dictionary from an iterable or transforming one dictionary into another.Using an if statement allows you to filter out values to create your new dictionary.


Q43)How does a function return values?

A return statement is used to end the execution of the function call and “returns” the result (value of the expression following the return keyword) to the caller. The statements after the return statements are not executed


Q44)Explain help() and dir() functions in Python.

Help() and dir(), are the two functions that are reachable from the python interpreter. Both functions are utilized for observing the combine dump of build-in-function.


Q45)Explain about Django session?

Django provides full support for anonymous sessions. The session framework lets you store and retrieve arbitrary data on a per-site-visitor basis. It stores data on the server side and abstracts the sending and receiving of cookies.

Q46)How would you define a block in Python?

To indicate a block of code in Python, you must indent each line of the block by the same amount. The two blocks of code in our example if-statement are both indented four spaces, which is a typical amount of indentation for Python.

Q47)Explain the procedure to minimize or lower the outages of Memcached server in your Python development?

The procedure to minimize or lower the outages of Memcached server in your Python development.
Use code to minimize cache stampedes to leave a minimal impact
Another way on a new machine is to use the lost machines IP address
Setting timeout value

Q48)What is the use of manage.py?

manage.py: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways. You can read all the details about manage.py in django-admin and manage.py. The inner mysite/ directory is the actual Python package for your project.

Q49)Is Django stable?
Django is committed to API stability and forwards-compatibility. You may need to make minor changes when upgrading the version of Django your project uses: see the “Backwards incompatible changes” section of the release note for the version or versions to which you are upgrading.


Q50)Write a program to count the number of capital letters in a file?

Python Program to count the number of capital letters in a file

def upper(string):
upper = 0  
for i in range(len(string)):
# For upper letters
elif (ord(string[i]) >= 65 and
ord(string[i]) <= 90):
upper += 1
print('Upper case characters = %s' %upper)
# Driver Code
string = 'God is Great'
upper(string)


Q51)Define generators in Python?

A Python generator is a function that produces a sequence of results. It works by maintaining its local state, so that the function can resume again exactly where it left off when called subsequent times.


Q52)Write a program to check whether the given number is prime or not?

# To take input from the user
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# prime numbers are greater than 1
if num > 1:
   # check for factors
   for i in range(2,num):
       if (num % i) == 0:
           print(num,"is not a prime number")
           print(i,"times",num//i,"is",num)
           break
   else:
       print(num,"is a prime number")
  # if input number is less than
# or equal to 1, it is not prime
else:
   print(num,"is not a prime number")


Q53)Define pickling and unpickling in Python.

Pickling” is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, and “unpickling” is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream (from a binary file or bytes-like object) is converted back into an object hierarchy.


Q54) What is __init__ in Python?

"__init__" is a reseved method in python classes. It is known as a constructor in object oriented concepts. This method called when an object is created from the class and it allow the class to initialize the attributes of a class.


Q55)Write Python code to check the given sequence is a palindrome or not?

Python program to check the given number is a palindrome or not

number=int(input("Enter any number :"))
#store a copy of this number
temp=number
#calculate reverse of this number
reverse_num=0
while(number>0):
extract last digit of this number
digit=number%10
#append this digit in reveresed number
reverse_num=reverse_num*10+digit
#floor divide the number leave out the last digit from number
number=number//10
#compare reverse to original number
if(temp==reverse_num):
print("The number is palindrome!")
else:
print("Not a palindrome")


Q56)Does multiple inheritances is supported in Python?

When a child class inherits from multiple parent classes, it is called multiple inheritance. Unlike Java and like C++, Python supports multiple inheritance.


Q57)What do you mean by Python literals?

A literal is a succinct and easily visible way to write a value. Literals represent the possible choices in primitive types for that language. Some of the choices of types of literals are often integers, floating point, Booleans and character strings.

String literals :: "halo" , '12345'
Int literals :: 0,1,2,-1,-2
Long literals :: 89675L
Float literals :: 3.14
Complex literals :: 12j
Boolean literals :: True or False
Special literals :: None
Unicode literals :: u"hello"
List literals :: [], [5,6,7]
Tuple literals :: (), (9,),(8,9,0)
Dict literals :: {}, {'x':1}
Set literals :: {8,9,10}


Q58)What is zip() function in Python?

The zip() function returns a zip object, which is an iterator of tuples where the first item in each passed iterator is paired together, and then the second item in each passed iterator are paired together etc.

If the passed iterators have different lengths, the iterator with the least items decides the length of the new iterator.

Syntax

zip(iterator1, iterator2, iterator3 ...)


Q59)What is Python's parameter passing mechanism?

All parameters (arguments) in the Python language are passed by reference. It means if you change what a parameter refers to within a function, the change also reflects back in the calling function.

Example

student={'Archana':28,'krishna':25,'Ramesh':32,'vineeth':25}
def test(student):
new={'alok':30,'Nevadan':28}
student.update(new)
print("Inside the function",student)
return
test(student)
print("outside the function:",student)

Q60) Explain the different ways to write a function using call by reference?

Python in different ways for write a function that known as “call by reference”. In this event , pass the argument as whole numbers, string, or tuples of the function. By “call by value” because cannot change the value of the immutable objects passed to the function.

#call by value;

String = “morning”;
def data(string):
	string = “Good Morning”
	print(“Inside the Function”,string)
data(string)
print(“Outside the Function”,string)

#call by Reference

def data(string):
string = “Good Morning”
print(“Inside the Function”,string)
data(string)
print(“Outside the Function”,string)

Q61)What is the difference between remove() function and del statement?

remove() delete the matching element/object whereas del and pop removes the element at a specific index.

remove : remove() removes the first matching value or object, not a specific indexing. lets say list.remove(value)

Example
list=[10,20,30,40]
list.remove(30)
print(list)

Example
list = [10,20,30,40,55]
del list[1]
print(list)

Q62)What is swapcase() function in the Python?

Python string swapcase() function is basically used to converts case of each character of the input string.

Example:


input_str = “Amazon Prime is a great OTT Platform
		input_str.swapcase()
		aMAZON pRIME IS A GREAT ott pLATFORM.


Q63)How to remove whitespaces from a string in Python?

It will print complete tuple. Output would be (‘abcd’, 786, 2.23, ‘john’, 70.200000000000003).

The strip() function basically removes the leading(front) and the trailing(end) spaces of the string.

Key points:

strip(): This function removes the leading(front) and the trailing(end) spaces from an array including the tabs(\t).

lstrip(): This function removes spaces from the left end of the string.

rstrip(): This function removes spaces from the right end of the string.

Example:


string = '   Safa Mulani is a student of Engineering Discipline.    '
print(f'String =\'{string}\'')
print(f'After Removing Leading Whitespaces String =\'{string.lstrip()}\'')
print(f'After Removing Trailing Whitespaces String =\'{string.rstrip()}\'')
print(f'After Trimming Whitespaces String =\'{string.strip()}\'')


Q64)Give an example of shuffle() method?

Python number method shuffle() randomizes the items of a list in place.


import random

list = [20, 16, 10, 5];
random.shuffle(list)
print "Reshuffled list : ",  list
random.shuffle(list)
print "Reshuffled list : ",  list
Reshuffled list :  [16, 5, 10, 20]
Reshuffled list :  [16, 5, 20, 10]


Q65)Define package in Python?

Packages are a way of structuring Python's module namespace by using “dotted module names”. Suppose you want to design a collection of modules (a “package”) for the uniform handling of sound files and sound data.


Q66)What is the difference between Python Arrays and lists?

Arrays can store data very compactly and are more efficient for storing large amounts of data. Arrays are great for numerical operations; lists cannot directly handle math operations.

For example, you can divide each element of an array by the same number with just one line of code.


Q67)What is self in Python?

In Python, the word self is the first parameter of methods that represents the instance of the class. Therefore, in order to call attributes and methods of a class, the programmer needs to use self.

Q68)What is the difference sort() and sorted function in python

sort() funtion sorts the only list data into ascending and decending order

sorted() function sorts the any data into asending to decending order

Q69)What are the difference beteen pop() and popitem() while working with 
dict data type.

pop() function removes the values by passing key as argument
popitem() function removes last key and value pair.


Q70)What are the advantages of Python Recursion?

Python Recursion reduces unnecessary calling of function that reduces length of program. Very flexible in data structure like stacks, queues, linked list and quick sort. Big and complex iterative solutions are easy and simple with Python recursion.


Q71)What are the disadvantages of Python Recursion?

Disadvantages of Python Recursion
Slow.
Logical but difficult to trace and debug.
Requires extra storage space. For every recursive calls separate memory is allocated for the variables.
Recursive functions often throw a Stack Overflow Exception when processing or operations are too large.

Q72)Why don’t Python lambda have any statement?

A lambda function doesn't contain a return statement because it will have only a single expression which is always returned by default.

Q73)How to get current directory using Python?

To find the current working directory in Python, use os. getcwd() , and to change the current working directory, use os. chdir(path)

Q74)Why Should We Use File Operation?

Python file handling (File I/O) is one of the essential topics for programmers and automation testers. It is required to work with files for either writing to a file or read data from it. Also, if you are not already aware, I/O operations are the costliest operations where a program can stumble.


Q75)Why should we close files?

The close() method of a file object flushes any unwritten information and closes the file object, after which no more writing can be done.
Python automatically closes a file when the reference object of a file is reassigned to another file. It is a good practice to use the close() method to close a file.


Q76)Is python statically typed or dynamically typed?

Python is dynamic typed and strong typed; Java is static typed and strong typed; PHP is dynamic typed and weak typed; C is static typed and weak typed (owing to its casting ability).


Q77)Is python strongly typed or weakly typed language?

Python is both a strongly typed and a dynamically typed language. Strong typing means that variables do have a type and that the type matters when performing operations on a variable.

Dynamic typing means that the type of the variable is determined only during runtime.

Q78)When is not a good time to use python generators?

In general, don't use a generator when you need list operations, like len(), reversed(), and so on. There may also be times when you don't want lazy evaluation (e.g. to do all the calculation up front so you can release a resource). In that case, a list expression might be better.

Q79)How to create a multidimensional list in Python?

Lists are a very widely use data structure in python. They contain a list of elements separated by comma. But sometimes lists can also contain lists within them. These are called nested lists or multidimensional lists.

Example:
    multlist = [[0 for columns in range(4)] for rows in range(3)
    print(multlist)
     Output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]


Q80)Explain how to make Forms in python.


form.name: The name of the field, if specified.
filename: If an FTP transaction, the client-side filename.
value: The value of the field as a string.
file: file object from which data can be read.
type: The content type, if applicable


Q81)List the common security issues that can be avoided by using Django?

Cross site scripting (XSS) protection.
Cross site request forgery (CSRF) protection.
SQL injection protection.
Clickjacking protection.
SSL/HTTPS.
Host header validation.
Referrer policy.
Session security.


Q82)What are docstrings in Python?

A docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method definition. Such a docstring becomes the __doc__ special attribute of that object.

All modules should normally have docstrings, and all functions and classes exported by a module should also have docstrings.


Q83)How can the ternary operators be used in python?

Ternary operators also known as conditional expressions are operators that evaluate something based on a condition being true or false.

It was added to Python in version 2.5. It simply allows to test a condition in a single line replacing the multiline if-else making the code compact.


Q84)What is Polymorphism in Python?

Polymorphism in python defines methods in the child class that have the same name as the methods in the parent class. In inheritance, the child class inherits the methods from the parent class.

Q85) How can we debug a Python program?

In order to run the debugger just type c and press enter. As the same suggests, PDB means Python debugger. To use the PDB in the program we have to use one of its method named set_trace().

Q86)How do you invoke the Python interpreter for interactive use?

Start the Python Interpreter

You can use it in a REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop) fashion. To enter interactive mode after running a script, you can pass –i before the script. The command python -c command [arg] … executes statements in command, and python -m module [arg]


Q87)What is Python String format and Python String replace?

Python String format() is a function used to replace, substitute, or convert the string with placeholders with valid values in the final string. It is a built-in function of the Python string class, which returns the formatted string as an output.
