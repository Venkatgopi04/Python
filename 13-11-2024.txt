Encupsulation in Python:
===============
Python supports Encupsulation.It is the process or methodlogy to hide the internal
implementation and showing the services what we are seeing.The main objective of
Encupsulation is provide the security to the data/information.

setter():It is used to set the data
getter():It is used to get  the data.


Ex1:
==
import time 
class Employees_Class:
    def setEid(self,Eid):
        self.Eid=Eid
    def getEid(self):
        return self.Eid 
    def setEname(self,Ename):
        self.Ename=Ename 
    def getEname(self):
        return self.Ename
    def setEsal(self,Esal):
        self.Esal=Esal 
    def getEsal(self):
        return self.Esal
    def setDesign(self,Design):
        self.Design=Design 
    def getDesign(self):
        return self.Design 
    def setCompany(self,Company):
        self.Company=Company 
    def getCompany(self):
        return self.Company
e1=Employees_Class()
e1.setEid(1001)
e1.setEname("Jessica_1")
e1.setEsal(29000)
e1.setDesign("DAD developer")
e1.setCompany("HCL")
print()
print("=====Employees_Details====")
print("Eid is:",e1.getEid())
print("Ename is:",e1.getEname())
print("Esal is:",e1.getEsal())
print("Design is:",e1.getDesign())
print("Company is:",e1.getCompany())
print()
time.sleep(2)
print("End  of an application")


File handling in Python:
===============
Python supports File handling.It is process or methodlogy to store the limited data 
and perform some operations on that data as per the application reqn.



While working with File Handling we do have following functions and attribute


->open():It is used to open the file
->close():It is used to close the file 
->name:It is used to know the name of the file
->mode:It is used tp know the mode of the file
->closed:It is used to closed the file or not
->readable():It is used to know wheather a file is readable or not 
->writable():It is used to know the wheather a file is writable or not



While working with File Handing we can insert following types of data.

->Alpha_numerical data
->Binary data


To insert the Alpha_numerical data we do have following modes

r --->read only
r+ --->read and write
w ---->write only 
w+ --->write and read 
x ---->Exclusive mode 
x+ ---->Exclusive and read mode 
a ---->append mode 
a+ ---->append and read mode



To insert Binary data we do have following modes:
================================
rb --->read only
r+b --->read and write
wb ---->write only 
w+b --->write and read 
xb ---->Exclusive mode 
x+b ---->Exclusive and read mode 
ab---->append mode 
a+b ---->append and read mode


Note:
====
Bydefault mode is read mode ----> r

Ex1:
===
import time 
f1=open("ABC.txt","r")
print("=====File_Details=====")
print("File_Name is:",f1.name)
print("File_Mode is:",f1.mode)
print("File is closed or not:",f1.closed)
print("File is readable or not:",f1.readable())
print("File is writable or not:",f1.writable())
print()
f1.close()
print()
time.sleep(2)
print("End of an application")


Ex2:
===
import time 
f1=open("ABC.txt")
print("=====File_Details=====")
print("File_Name is:",f1.name)
print("File_Mode is:",f1.mode)
print("File is closed or not:",f1.closed)
print("File is readable or not:",f1.readable())
print("File is writable or not:",f1.writable())
print()
f1.close()
print()
time.sleep(2)
print("End of an application")


Ex3:
===
import time 
f1=open("ABC.txt","r+")
print("=====File_Details=====")
print("File_Name is:",f1.name)
print("File_Mode is:",f1.mode)
print("File is closed or not:",f1.closed)
print("File is readable or not:",f1.readable())
print("File is writable or not:",f1.writable())
print()
f1.close()
print()
time.sleep(2)
print("End of an application")


Ex4:
===
import time 
f1=open("ABC.txt","w")
print("=====File_Details=====")
print("File_Name is:",f1.name)
print("File_Mode is:",f1.mode)
print("File is closed or not:",f1.closed)
print("File is readable or not:",f1.readable())
print("File is writable or not:",f1.writable())
print()
f1.close()
print()
time.sleep(2)
print("End of an application")

Ex5:
===
import time 
f1=open("ABC.txt","w+")
print("=====File_Details=====")
print("File_Name is:",f1.name)
print("File_Mode is:",f1.mode)
print("File is closed or not:",f1.closed)
print("File is readable or not:",f1.readable())
print("File is writable or not:",f1.writable())
print()
f1.close()
print()
time.sleep(2)
print("End of an application")


While working with File Handling to create new file and its content we do have following
predefine functions

->write()
->writelines()


->write():
======
It is a predefine function in python while working with File handling.The main 
objective of write() is to create a new file and it's content.


Ex1:
===
import time 
f2=open("ihub_1.txt","w")
f2.write("ABC")
f2.write("abc")
f2.write("123")
print()
print("New file is created successfully")
print()
f2.close()
print()
print("End of an application")


Ex2:
===
import time 
f2=open("ihub_1.txt","w")
f2.write("ABC\n")
f2.write("abc\n")
f2.write("123\n")
print()
print("New file is created successfully")
print()
f2.close()
print()
print("End of an application")


Ex3:
===
import time 
f2=open("ihub_1.txt","w")
f2.write("12345\n")
f2.write("54321\n")
f2.write("11331\n")
print()
print("New file is created successfully")
print()
f2.close()
print()
print("End of an application")


Ex4:
===
import time 
f2=open("ihub_1.txt","a")
f2.write("ABC\n")
f2.write("abc\n")
f2.write("_@$\n")
print()
print("New file is created successfully")
print()
f2.close()
print()
print("End of an application")
