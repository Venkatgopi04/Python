Python Programming Language:
====================


Q1)How to create a Python_File?
======================
We can create a Python_File using .py extension with Any_Name.


Python_Valid_File_Names:
================
ihub1.py
test1.py
demo1.py
rahul1.py
priya1.py


In_Valid_Python_Names:
===============
12345.py
ihub   1.py


->print()
->id()
->type()


->print():
======
It is a predefine function in Python.The main objective of print() function is to 
display the content on console/application console using '' or "" or '''''' or """"""
or variable_name/an identifier_name.


Ex1:
===
print('Core Python session is going on at IHUB')
print("Core Python session is going on at IHUB")
print('''Core Python session is going on at IHUB''')
print("""Core Python session is going on at IHUB""")
Eid=1001 
print(Eid)


OUTPUT:
======
Core Python session is going on at IHUB
Core Python session is going on at IHUB
1001

C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Python_Development>python ihub1.py
Core Python session is going on at IHUB
Core Python session is going on at IHUB


Ex2:
===
print('Core Python session is going on at IHUB')
print()
print("Core Python session is going on at IHUB")
print()
print('''Core Python session is going on at IHUB''')
print()
print("""Core Python session is going on at IHUB""")
print()
Eid=1001 
print(Eid)
print()
print('End of an application')


Core Python session is going on at IHUB
Core Python session is going on at IHUB
1001

C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Python_Development>py ihub1.py
Core Python session is going on at IHUB
Core Python session is going on at IHUB
Core Python session is going on at IHUB
Core Python session is going on at IHUB
