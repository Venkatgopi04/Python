Q1)What is a Module?
==============
A Module can be represent as if it contains variables,functions,methods,classes,
objects then it is said to be a Module.Our Python Program/Python Script itself is a
module

Ex1:
 ===
     test1.py ----> A Pyhon Module


Q2)What is a Package?
==============
Package can be represent as collection of one or more than one module then it is
said to be a Package.

Ex1:
===
     ->Package_1
             test1.py
             test2.py
             test3.py


Q3)What is a Libary?
=============
A libary can be represent as collection of one or more than one package then 
it is said to be a Libary.

Ex1:
====
       Libary_1:

           ->Package_1
             test1.py
             test2.py
             test3.py

           ->Package_2
             test1.py
             test2.py
             test3.py

        ->Package_3
             test1.py
             test2.py
             test3.py


Backend ----> Flask
FrontEnd ---->ReactJS


Q4)What is a Framework?:
================
A Framework can be represent as collection of one or more than one 
Libaries then it is said to be Framework.


Ex1:
===
      ->Framework

 
           Libary_1:

           ->Package_1
             test1.py
             test2.py
             test3.py

           ->Package_2
             test1.py
             test2.py
             test3.py

        ->Package_3
             test1.py
             test2.py
             test3.py


     Libary_2:

           ->Package_1
             test1.py
             test2.py
             test3.py

           ->Package_2
             test1.py
             test2.py
             test3.py

        ->Package_3
             test1.py
             test2.py
             test3.py

 
        Libary_3:

           ->Package_1
             test1.py
             test2.py
             test3.py

           ->Package_2
             test1.py
             test2.py
             test3.py

        ->Package_3
             test1.py
             test2.py
             test3.py



Packages in Python:
============
->Package can represent as collection of one or more than one module.

->In Pyhton we can define a package using a file_name as __init__.py which 
is empty file

->Package is nothing but a folder/directory in O/S

->As per the application reqn we can create nested packages as well.
